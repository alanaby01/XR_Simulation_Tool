# XR Simulation Tool

# Project Abstract

Traditionally, product development that combines industrial and mechanical
design are done in softwares like Fusion360 and SolidWorks, which offers a 3-D
view of the structure in a 2-D screen, which constraints the designer to properly
visualise the machine and its working.
The project aims to create a virtual development tool for designers and machine
architects, to build what they visualise in their minds into a virtual reality space.
The virtual world thus created, will operate according to the laws of physics,
allowing the designers to see through the end of product development cycle.

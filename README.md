# XR Simulation Tool

# Project Abstract

Traditionally, product development that combines industrial and mechanical
design are done in softwares like Fusion360 and SolidWorks, which offers a 3-D
view of the structure in a 2-D screen, which constraints the designer to properly
visualise the machine and its working.
The project aims to create a virtual development tool for designers and machine
architects, to build what they visualise in their minds into a virtual reality space.
The virtual world thus created, will operate according to the laws of physics,
allowing the designers to see through the end of product development cycle.

## Meetup Details

### 27-Sept-2020
1. Hardware cost estimated around Rs. 5000

2. Hardware implementation

2.1 Using two cameras, attached to the side of XR glasses, the environment around the user is estimated for the computer(Raspberry Pi) module to get an estimate of the environment.

2.2 Using software developed using Unity and tools like ARCore, various objects related to the designing tool are placed and anchored in the environment of the user through the glasses. 

### 11-Oct-2020

1. Hardware cannot be effectively made under this circumstances.

2. A prototype, which includes the basic functionalities of the project, have been initiated

#### Prototype details

1. An application in AR, that can be build on an Android/iOS which has the following funtionalities.

1.1 Measure the required area, on which the machine is made (Plane detection)

1.2 Adding the inventory of design software, which includes mechanical systems like gears.

1.3 Using hand gestures, the parts of the machine can be moved.

1.4 Adding basic physics rules, like gravity, for users to visualise the working of the machine.
